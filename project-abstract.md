# Project Abstract

## Project description

This project focuses on deploying and optimizing my semesterProject (B4 with Natalia). The project is a webapp, and I will use Kubernetes, Terraform and Firebase to deploy and optimize it. Eventually, this should allow for effective user interaction and feedback for out UX research and presentation at the showtime.

### Context

Our web app currently moves into the user testing phase, a stable and accessible deployment is essential for feedback. Right now the app needs to be set up manually and is not accessible for the average user. Futhermore we need to access the app at the showtime event. This project aims to change that.

### Purpose

The objective is to deploy a version of the web app that is tagged for user testing, ensuring reliability. The Goal is to set up an environment where users can interact with the app and provide feedback for further development.

### Method

I plan to use Kubernetes for the app's deployment and Terraform with Firebase for managing the infrastructure. Tools are not 100% certain, e.g., I will find out in the process if my chosen tools work for me and the project. I want to create a user-friendly access and stable environment, essential for successful user testing. Potential challenges are user accessibility and app performance during testing. A risk is that I will switch tools during the project, which could lead to delays. I will further research and test tools before using them in the project.

### Expected Results

The successful deployment of a user-ready version of the web app, which is somewhat stable and accessible by others. (All of this should be working at the showtime event)

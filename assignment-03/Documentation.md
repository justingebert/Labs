#### Initial Thoughts:
- very well-made website / should be in info 1-3 

#### Process:
- last optional rebase know how to do it with cherry-pick but couldn't figure out how to do it with interactive rebase

- protection of main branch:
  -  review and approval from others are useful
  - status checks for CI
  - require linear history (if that's the chosen git workflow)

#### Outcome:
- finished all the tasks
